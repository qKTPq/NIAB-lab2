Congratulations to Dr. Pichaya In-na for published in Architectural Science Review.

Can we combine two very distinct disciplines? Yesterday, our latest research work, where "Sciences Meet Designs" has been published in Architectural Science Review!

It has been a difficult task to implement living microorganisms onto sophisticated building materials. Nevertheless, we made our attempt to immobilise microalgae onto ceramic components. We chose to work with microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) because of their ability to capture CO2 and produce O2 in the atmosphere.

Hopefully, we will keep on improving the process and made living building components become possible in the real world!
